Deploy an NGINX version 1.16.1 service to the swarm and change the listening port to 8081

Scale the swarm down to 1 task and then up to 5 tasks

Apply a rolling update to the NGINX service to latest

Drain the node, then set it back to active

# To obtain the IP address
ip a

sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <IP address> --listen-addr 0.0.0.0

sudo docker service create --replicas 3 --name webserver nginx:1.16.1

# To validate that the service is created and running
sudo docker service ls

# Since the the published ports is blank as the web server is not accessible, we need to publish a listening port
sudo docker service update --publish-add 8081:80 webserver
# Now the column PORTS has an entry, *:8081->80/tcp
# To confirm that the port is up and running, go to localhost:8081/

# Scaling the service means adding/removing extra containers to provide the same function
sudo docker service scale webserver=1

# To view the container running the service
sudo docker ps

# To scale the service up to 5 tasks
sudo docker service scale webserver=5

# To apply a rolling update to push the latest version of the Docker image to the containers
sudo docker service update --image nginx webserver

# To stop the node from receiving requests to the contain<er running on it and put it into a form of maintenance node
sudo docker node update --availability drain patrick-virtual-machine

# To turn the node back to active
sudo docker node update --availability active patrick-virtual-machine
